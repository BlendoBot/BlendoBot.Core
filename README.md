# BlendoBot.Core
## A Discord bot framework for .NET 5.0

BlendoBot is a Discord bot framework intended for easy implementation of new functionalities and commands. It currently uses [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) to operate with Discord, but it also has its own interfaces and common code functionality to allow front-ends to easily add and remove functionality from the bot.

### What do I do with this?
BlendoBot.Core is published to the BlendoBot NuGet. If you're developing your own BlendoBot functionality, your projects should all include this NuGet package.
